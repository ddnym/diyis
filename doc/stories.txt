DIYIS stories and their rough order of implementation

Story: name, author, searchable? (are page ids hidden), private? (is it visible on public list)
	create
	edit
	list
	delete
	play
Page: storyId, tag, text, anchor?
	create
	edit
	delete?	- orphan check, you can hide the choice via condition, so this is not necessary
Choice: pageId, text, targetId
	create
	edit
	delete? - orphan check, you can use condition to hide an unwanted one anyway so this is not necessary
	ordering
	apply
Variables: find storage mechanism (session)
	need to explicitly define them, or are created on definition
	defaults?
Action: choiceId, var, op, value
	create
	edit
	ordering
	delete
	page actions?
Condition: allow editor to hide based on Variables, order shouldn't matter
	create
	edit
	delete
User: authentication, Devise?
	pages and stories mark who modified them
	profile?
Role: by story and user
	Owner - can change user roles
	Add - can add new pages
	Edit - can modify own pages
	FullEdit - can edit anyone
	delete? - can be dangerous, leave entire areas orphaned
Markup: BBCode
	font size, color, bold, italic, underline to start
	maybe others as needed
Interpolation: variable display
	page text
	choice text
Status: line of Interpolated text
	show
Tagging: probably using a plugin, story level
Images: still not sure, bandwidth, storage, safety, all are issues

Need to determine what editing UI and playing UI look like.
